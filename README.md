# Magic-Wand
Magic Wand is a barcode scanner utility for EHR training environments. At its core, the app is a compiled AutoHotKey GUI script.

## Quick Start
If you just want to add some barcodes and test the app all you need to do is save the following files to a directory on your computer, add barcodes, and run.

### Required Files
* MagicWand.exe
* MW.ico (because it's pretty)
* barcodelist.txt

### Adding Barcodes
1. Open barcodelist.txt in your editor of choice
2. Add barcodes in the format "Stuff you want to display|barcodetoscan" without the quotes
⋅⋅1. Each line in the file represents a barcode
⋅⋅2. The easiest way to add a barcode is to scan it into the file after the pipe character
⋅⋅3. You can also create a barcode without a scanner. Consult your EHR documentation for EHR specific barcode formatting
